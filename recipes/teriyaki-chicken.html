                <dd>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes.</dd>
                <dd>They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties.</dd>
                <dd>Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.</dd>

       <div class="steps""> <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:-10px;">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
                <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class=notes><h3 style="color:yellow;">Cook's Notes!</h3>
            <p>Try to cut the pineapple chunks approximately the same size as the shrimp for even grilling.</p>
            <p>If using wooden skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.</p>
