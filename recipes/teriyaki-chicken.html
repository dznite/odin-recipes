                <dd>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes.</dd>
                <dd>They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties.</dd>
                <dd>Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.</dd>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <strong>Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
                <li>½ fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
                <li>skewers</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro <em>(Optional)</em></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds <em>(Optional)</em></li>
               
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
                <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
            <p>Try to cut the pineapple chunks approximately the same size as the shrimp for even grilling.</p>
            <p>If using wooden skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.</p>
